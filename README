Long story made short :

Starting point is an article from P Rowlands available on arxiv :
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0301071
Some articles from JosÃ© B. Almeida are on Arxiv and give more hints.

The CAS library is sympy.

Code works on Debian Wheezy
Code works on Mac OS X Tiger (10.4.11) with fink distribution for python (2.7.5) and latex (pdfTeX 3.1415926-2.3-1.40.12 (TeX Live 2011/Fink) )

git clone https://github.com/jdekozak/dirac5d.git
cd dirac5d
git submodule init
git submodule update
python ./dirac5d.py

Or :
docker build --rm -t jupyter/galgebra-notebook .
docker run -p 80:8888 -e NB_UID=500 -e NB_GID=500 --user root -v /home/ec2-user/dirac5d:/home/jovyan/work jupyter/galgebra-notebook

Details :

1/ Is it possible to write the Dirac equation with geometric algebra ?
2/ Is it possible to write the Dirac equation with a geometric algebra over the reals and NOT the complex ?
3/ Is it possible to find solutions of the Dirac equation without the classical physical assumptions (eg. mass is a positive real) ?

Then,
=> Are results from the classic Dirac equation still valid ?
=> Are there any new results with this approach ?
