Long story made short :

Starting point is an article from P Rowlands available on arxiv :
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0301071
Some articles from Jos√© B. Almeida are on Arxiv and give more hints.

The CAS library is sympy.

Code works on Debian Wheezy
Code works on Mac OS X Tiger (10.4.11) with fink distribution for python (2.7.5) and latex (pdfTeX 3.1415926-2.3-1.40.12 (TeX Live 2011/Fink) )

export PYTHONPATH=<clone dir>/sympy
python ./CL1_4.py

Details :

1/ Is it possible to write the Dirac equation with geometric algebra ?
2/ Is it possible to write the Dirac equation with a geometric algebra over the reals and NOT the complex ?
3/ Is it possible to find solutions of the Dirac equation without the classical physical assumptions (eg. mass is a positive real) ?

Then,
=> Are results from the classic Dirac equation still valid ?
=> Are there any new results with this approach ?
